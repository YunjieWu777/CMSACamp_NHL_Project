## Research Question

- Compare the performance of different models predicting the possible outcomes of a shot

--

- Started with the idea of an expected goals model

--

- Now focused on all of the potential outcomes resulting from a shot in hockey

--

- Want to find the best way to estimate the value of a shot attempt, and potentially a player's impact on that value

---

### What Are the Potential Outcomes from a Shot?

* First, shot can either hit the net or miss the net.

--

* If shot hits the net, it is either a goal or not a goal

--

* If shot hits the net and is not a goal, there are several possible outcomes of that shot coded in the Moneypuck dataset

---

## Flow Chart for Shots on Net

```

---

### The Moneypuck Dataset

Loaded in the dataset of all the shots from 2010 season to 2020 season (includes shots as of 2021/7/8) in NHL from [`moneypuck`](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/sure/2021/materials/data/xy_examples/moneypuck_shots_2020.csv)

--

* There's 137 columns of 1,146,536 rows

--

* Each row represent a singular shot taken; contains information about Player info, Info about the shot, Team context, and Game context

--

```{r display-data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
recent_season %>% slice_head(n = 4) %>% dplyr::select(season,awaySkatersOnIce,shotAngleAdjusted,xCordAdjusted,shotType,goal,xGoal) %>% gt()
```

---

### About Moneypuck's Expected Goals Model

* Predicts probability of each shot being a goal

--

* Uses distance from net, angle of shot, type of shot, and what happened before the shot

--

* Built on 800,000 shots in the NHL from 2007 - 2015

--

* Built using gradient boosting

---

### Calibration of Moneypuck xG Model


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align="center"}
recent_season %>%
  mutate(bin_pred_prob = round(xGoal / 0.05) * 0.05) %>%
  group_by(bin_pred_prob) %>%
  summarize(n_attempts = n(),
            bin_actual_prob = mean(goal)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bin_pred_prob, y = bin_actual_prob)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = n_attempts)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "darkred",
              linetype = "dashed") + 
  coord_equal() + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) + 
  theme_reach()+ 
  labs(x = "Predicted Probability",
       y = "Actual Probability",
       size = "Number of Attempts")
```

### Calibration on subsets: situation

### Start from Individual Binomial Logistic Regression Models

* Looked at more than just Expected Goals - including other outcomes that could occur from a shot; build 7 simple logistic regression models, one for each outcome and another one for whether the shot was on goal

--

* Response variables: one column for each outcome from the original data

--

* Predictor variables: shot distance, shot angle, shot type, shot rebound, shot rush

--

* Looked at shots only taken in even-strength situations; meaning, 5 players on the ice for both teams

---

### Predictor Variables

- Shot distance: Shot distance adjusted for arena recording bias
- Shot angle: Absolute value of the shot angle
- Shot type: Type of the shot (7 in total)
- Shot rebound: Set to 1 if the last event was a shot and within 3 seconds of this shot
- Shot rush: Set to 1 if the last event was in another zone and within 4 seconds of this shot

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Final_0730_files/rink.png")
```

---

### Building a Multinomial Logistic Regression Model

* Created an new column representing the "outcome" of a shot, this was our response variable

--

* Same predictors as before (distance, angle, etc.)

--

* Built 3 models: all shots, on goal, and miss net conditions; focus on all shots condition right now

  group_by(outcome_type, bin_pred_prob) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(n_plays = n(),
            n_scoring_event = length(which(outcome == outcome_type)),
            bin_actual_prob = n_scoring_event / n_plays,
            bin_se = sqrt((bin_actual_prob * (1 - bin_actual_prob)) / n_plays)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(bin_upper = pmin(bin_actual_prob + 2 * bin_se, 1),
         bin_lower = pmax(bin_actual_prob - 2 * bin_se, 0))
```

### Building a Random Forest Model

* Built a random forest model with same predictor variables, response variable still the outcome variable representing all potential outcomes of a shot

--

* Random forest models use many different decision trees to classify observations in groups

--

* Can capture more complex features of a model to give best accuracy

### Building Player Effects Models


* 5 logistic regression models, Out of Zone as reference group

--

* Same predictors as before (distance, angle, etc.)

--

* Include random effect term for shooters and goalies

### Compare Brier Score

* Multinomial logistic regression Model

```{r}
0.7107121
```


* Random Forest Model

```{r}
0.7132008
```


* Individual binomial logistic regression model with player effects

```{r}
0.6442002
```

---

### Future work

* Generalize our result to situation other than evenstrength; keep working on other two conditions.

--

* Continuing this research, would want to look at heatmaps at a goalie / player level - how do goalies and players differ in expected outcomes from "average" goalies/players?
