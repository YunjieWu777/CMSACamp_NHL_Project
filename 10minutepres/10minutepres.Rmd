## Research Question

- Compare the performance of different models predicting the possible outcomes of a shot

--

- Started with the idea of an expected goals model

--

- Now focused on all of the potential outcomes resulting from a shot in hockey

--

- Want to find the best way to estimate the value of a shot attempt, and potentially a player's impact on that value

---

### What Are the Potential Outcomes from a Shot?

* First, shot can either hit the net or miss the net.

--

* If shot hits the net, it is either a goal or not a goal

--

* If shot hits the net and is not a goal, there are several possible outcomes of that shot coded in the Moneypuck dataset

---

### The Moneypuck Dataset

Loaded in the dataset of all the shots from 2010 season to 2020 season (includes shots as of 2021/7/8) in NHL from [`moneypuck`](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/sure/2021/materials/data/xy_examples/moneypuck_shots_2020.csv)

--

* There's 137 columns of 1,146,536 rows

--

* Each row represent a singular shot taken; contains information about Player info, Info about the shot, Team context, and Game context

--

```{r display-data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
recent_season %>% slice_head(n = 4) %>% dplyr::select(season,awaySkatersOnIce,shotAngleAdjusted,xCordAdjusted,shotType,goal,xGoal) %>% gt()
```

---

### About Moneypuck's Expected Goals Model

* Predicts probability of each shot being a goal

--

* Uses distance from net, angle of shot, type of shot, and what happened before the shot

---

### Building a Multinomial Logistic Regression Model

* Looked at more than just Expected Goals - including other outcomes that could occur from a shot; Created an new column representing the "outcome" of a shot, this was our response variable

--

* Our predictor variables were: shot distance, shot angle, shot type, shot rebound, shot rush

--

* Looked at shots only taken in even strength situations; meaning, 5 players on the ice for both teams

--

* Built 3 models: all shots, on goal, and miss net conditions; focus on all shots condition in this video

---

### Predictor Variables

- Shot distance: Shot distance adjusted for arena recording bias
- Shot angle: Absolute value of the shot angle
- Shot type: Type of the shot (7 in total)
- Shot rebound: Set to 1 if the last event was a shot and within 3 seconds of this shot
- Shot rush: Set to 1 if the last event was in another zone and within 4 seconds of this shot

### Building Player Effects Models


* 5 logistic regression models, Out of Zone as reference group

--

* Same predictors as before (distance, angle, etc.)

--

* Include random effect term for shooters and goalies

mean(((all_gl$outcome_type=="GoalieFroze")-all_gl$GoalieFroze)^2)+
mean(((all_gl$outcome_type=="PlayInZone")-all_gl$PlayInZone)^2)+

### Future work

* Continuing this research, would want to look at heatmaps at a goalie / player level - how do goalies and players differ in expected outcomes from "average" goalies/players?
