# Predicting Shot Outcomes in the National Hockey League (NHL)

## Introduction

This is the code for the summer reserach project of CMU 2021 CMSACamp

- We built ML models including multinomial logistic regression and random forest using R to predict possible outcomes of a shot in NHL and investigated the impact of individual players as a contributing factor

- A video summarizing our work can be found in this [offical website](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/summer2021/) and is also embedded below
